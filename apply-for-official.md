To be honest. I'm quite afraid that this will already scare you, but it's seen everywhere.

Applicants should note :

• Telegram is our only official platform for applying official for now. Check out telegram group (t.me/NarvisOS) .

• Team's official language is English, we accept a little bit hindi in chat, but minimize it.

• Continued support to your device is expected. Unless you have a reason for pausing support temporaily (e.g. lack of server, exams incoming, etc.), we will not tolerate maintainers not giving builds to users for 3 months continusly.

• Do send us your trees so we can check if everything is good, trees are very important, you know :)

• Please use common sense, not everyone is your "bro" .

• Maintainers must have a GitHub account.

• Maintainers must know how to use git correctly.

• Maintainers must maintain proper ownership on commit changes and commit history. This helps us keep our ROM healthy :)

• Maintainers must have some basic knowledge on reading logs/ fixing bugs.

Finishing with yourself now, let's talk about your device.

• Device must be buildable with public trees that has a valid commit history.

• Device must have a working recovery (TWRP preferred) that is publicly available.

• Device should have basic features working (call, ril, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.)

• Device must be able to make data connections via SIM and Wi-Fi, if device supports DualSIM you should have DualSim working too. (exceptions for pads here as some pads do not have SIM slots)

• Device must have a working camera (exceptions for phones that don't have one )

• Device tree should be clean.

Note : Once you and your device are successfully accepted (congrats !), you will have access to our team chat. We will help to solve problems based on Narvis OS.
